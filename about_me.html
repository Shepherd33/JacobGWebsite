    <p>
    My name is Jacob Gray. I was born in Texas, but I now live in Indiana. 
    All my life, I've had a love for science, engineering, and quality design.
    Which led me to Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology where I currently major in the multidisciplinary major of Engineering Design.
    With the knowlegde I've gained from my studies and real-life internship experience, I hope to use my skills to design a better world for us all.
