          Throughout my academic life, I have struggled to manage my assignments effectively. 
          With multiple pieces of homework to keep track of, I often forget assignments entirely, realizing too late that they are due. 
          Although I've tried different tracking methods, they have been unsuccessful either due to lack of organization or because I found the formats unintuitive. 
          To address this, I plan to set up an Access database with the following key features: 
          I want to be able to add new assignments (or other entries like classes) by typing the assignment name, class, and due date. 
          It should also automatically fill in other details, such as the class code, for better consistency and reduced data entry errors. 
          It should take the assignment's due date and display the time remaining for each assignment. 
          It should also be organizing assignments by due date, so the closest deadlines are prioritized. 
          I also want to be able to print out weekly reports that show assignments due in the current week while highlighting any upcoming assignments for the following week. 
          I currently plan to structure the database with four tables to keep information organized across key relational categories like assignments, classes, professors, and more.
          If it's possible, I'd like to add certain stretch features, like being able to print a final semester report that shows every completed assignment for the term as a satisfying summary of progress.
